    "\n",
    "I turned off GitHub Copilot Autocomplete and primarily used AI to transcribe my thoughts via Whisper (words) into clear strategy (plain text) #CS110-AlgoStratDataStruct style. My approach centered around a thorough understanding and implementation of the A* search algorithm to effectively solve the 8-puzzle problem. Before even beginning to write code, I invested significant time in researching the core principles of A*, exploring various heuristic functions, and gaining a solid grasp of the puzzle's challenges. The foundational knowledge from CS110, particularly the principles of algorithm design and strategic problem-solving, heavily influenced my methodology. While initially I felt uncertain about the most efficient coding strategies, my extensive research phase was crucial in clarifying these points and building a strong conceptual foundation before moving to implementation. I relied heavily on academic resources and explored different search strategies to ensure a robust and informed approach, ensuring I could implement a solution rooted in solid computer science principles rather than relying on automated code generation. During the coding phase, I made conscious decisions driven by my research and analytical evaluation. For example, in choosing a heuristic function, I started by considering the basic misplaced tiles and Manhattan distance heuristics. However, through further investigation, I opted to also implement a more sophisticated heuristic, incorporating linear conflict detection. My analysis indicated that while Manhattan distance is admissible, incorporating linear conflicts could lead to a more informed search and improve performance, particularly for more complex puzzle states. I also evaluated different options for managing the search frontier, ultimately deciding on a priority queue to efficiently prioritize nodes with the lowest estimated total cost."
