    "The function first checks if the provided puzzle state is valid by ensuring it is a square grid and contains the correct set of numbers (if not, it returns error code -1). A priority queue (frontier) is used to manage puzzle states, prioritizing states with the lowest estimated cost (f = g + h), where g is the path cost, and h is the heuristic estimate of remaining moves. The explored states are stored in a set for fast lookup to avoid revisiting states, implementing a graph search that ensures each state is expanded only once. The search continues by expanding nodes with the lowest estimated cost, generating child states, and adding unexplored ones to the frontier until the goal state is reached. If the goal state is found, the function reconstructs the path from the start state to the goal state. The algorithm also tracks the number of nodes expanded and the maximum size of the frontier to provide insight into the search process. If no solution is found, it returns an error code -2 indicating that the puzzle is unsolvable."
